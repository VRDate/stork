== First Setup

When you first load Tigase Messenger, you will be presented with our logo and a button indicating that you have an XMPP account.

If you do not have one, visit https://xmpp.net/directory.php to select a federated server to register and obtain an XMPP account.

Once you have credential information handy, go ahead and enter this information now.

Once the application logs in, you will be presented with your user roster and you are ready to use!

== Roster view

The roster will show all contacts in your roster retrieved from the server you login from.  You will have a combined roster if you have multiple accounts logged in at the same time.

To initiate a chat with a contact, simply tap their contact name.

To add a contact to your roster, tap the "+" button at the bottom right and fill out the appropiate forms. They will be added to your roster and a presence subscription request will be sent to them. Should the user accept your request, they will likely add you back. When that happens, accept the add request when it shows up in your notifications window. Once that happens, thier status will be shown in your roster.

=== Status indicators

In your roster, users will display a colored circle indicting thier status.  See the table below to see what each color means.

=== Roster Options

Tapping the ... on the top right or pressing the menu button on the phone will reveal two options for the roster menu:

.Sort by which allows you to sort the Roster by presence or name.

== Chat View

This view will show all your recent chats.  All active chats, chats that have not been archived, and any groupchats you are a part of will be listed here.

To close any chat, long-press the chat you wish to remove and select Archive Chat.  This will close the chat from this menu, but the chat will be preserved the next time you bring the chat window up from the roster.
